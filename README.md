query: 1. should i be using h1 and h2 for the headings? my rationale for using them is because they convey semantic meaning, but i was unable to customise their size by using it, as i set font-size to clamp. the problem with that is the font-size will always default to the maximum (since the heading default has a very large rem, making it unresponsive as a result). should i thus be using span elements instead?

problems faced: was stuck for quite a long time on why my image was not filling up the picture div - turns out i set max-inline-width and not inline-size to 100%

the ids and xref to the ids have to be unique in svgs, else it will not work.

this was the longest challenge so far (and still not done!), spent literally 12h, of which 8h was the hero image. trying to position it like the figma was (and will still be when i get back to it tmr), literal hell
i should not have set overflow-x and overflow-y:hidden on the body tag, it should have been on desktop-div!!
